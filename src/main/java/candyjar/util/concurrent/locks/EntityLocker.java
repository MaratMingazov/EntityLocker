/**
 * EntityLocker is a reusable utility class that provides synchronization mechanism similar to row-level DB locking.
 * The class is supposed to be used by the components that are responsible for managing storage and caching of different type of entities in the application. EntityLocker itself does not deal with the entities, only with the IDs (primary keys) of the entities.
 * Features:
 * 1. EntityLocker supports different types of entity IDs (implemented as Generic Class).
 * 2. EntityLocker allow the caller to specify which entity does it want to work with (using entity ID), and designate the boundaries of the code that should have exclusive access to the entity (called “protected code”).
 * 3. For any given entity, EntityLocker guarantees that at most one thread executes protected code on that entity. If there’s a concurrent request to locks the same entity, the other thread wait until the entity becomes available.
 * 4. EntityLocker allows concurrent execution of protected code on different entities.
 * 5. EntityLocker allows reentrant locking.
 * 6. EntityLocker allows the caller to specify timeout for locking an entity using tryLock(timeout) method.
 * 7. EntityLocker implements protection from deadlocks. You can use tryLock() method for this reason
 * 8. EntityLocker implements global locks. Protected code that executes under a global locks not executes concurrently with any other protected code.
